## Introduction
Heart disease classification is a crucial task in healthcare where the goal is to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data. Logistic regression is chosen as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.

## Project Structure
- README.md: Overview of the project.
- heart_disease_data.csv: Dataset containing heart-related features and corresponding labels (0 for healthy heart, 1 for defective heart).
- heart_disease_classification.py: Python script containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.

## Dependencies
- numpy: For numerical computations and array manipulations.
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and tools.

## Results
After training the logistic regression model on the heart disease data, the following results were achieved:

- Training Data Accuracy: 85%
- Test Data Accuracy: 81%

Based on the trained model, predictions can be made for new patient data.
